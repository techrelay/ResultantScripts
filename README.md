# Resultant Scripts



*******If you would like to contribute scripts or make changes to exisiting ones please submit a pull request*******

This Repo will house all of the scripts I Write as well as ones I have found/saved/given etc.. that would be useful for the Resultant MM Teams. 

The Folders are organized by Script Type with some subfolders inside of those for more specific tasks. I will keep these readme's updated with discriptions and examples of how to use each of the scripts.
